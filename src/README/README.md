# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts stock closing prices using historical market data
and a Linear Regression model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

## Project Workflow
1. Collected historical stock data
2. Cleaned and preprocessed data
3. Selected relevant features
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated performance
6. Visualized actual vs predicted prices

## Results
The model successfully predicts stock closing prices and visualizes
actual vs predicted trends.

## Future Improvements
- LSTM / Deep Learning
- Real-time stock prediction
- Web app using Streamlit or Flask
